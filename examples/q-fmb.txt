Title: Multiple blanks
1. After the following C statements, a's value is [11], b's value is [101],
and c[0]'s value is [110].

Note that here c[0] is not a blank to fill because the left bracket is not
after a space. We can also manually escape the bracket, like \[example].

<pre>
int    a = 10;
int    b = 100;
int    c[2];
c[0] = a ++ + b ++;
</pre>
